# About the Ohio Information Security Forum

The Ohio Information Security Forum (OISF) is a group of professionals and
enthusiasts with a shared information security, network and system
administration, engineering, and related computing technology backgrounds.

## Peer-to-Peer Networking

* Sharing knowledge of security technologies
* Sharing expertise and solutions to issues
* Collaborating with fellow information security peers
* Conducting training programs for security and non-security professionals
* Sharing experiences with security products and solutions

We all have the common objective to better secure our digital world. In doing
so, open discussions center on security issues which include:

* Emerging threats and vulnerabilities
* Hacking techniques and trends
* Defense techniques & strategies
* Laws & regulations
* Recent trends in security

## Monthly Meetings

Since 2006, we have been meeting regularly the second Thursday of each month.
With the help of Sinclair Community College, the OISF has been able to regularly
host meetings at The Learning Center at Miami Valley Research Park, 1900
Founders Drive in Kettering, Ohio (for details, see our Details page).

During the last three years, we have been fortunate to have a varied group of
security professionals participating in the Ohio Information Security Forum. As
a result, discussions are an integral part to the success of OISF meetings –
discussions that reveal the many aspects to the security challenges we all face
in today’s marketplace.

The OISF begins each meeting (currently 6:00pm) with a time to socialize with
peers. And, with thanks to our sponsors, food and refreshments are served. Come
early – even with plenty of food, the growth in attendance doesn’t always assure
latecomers to a slice of leftover pizza. YOU are the key to great meetings.
Tutorials, demonstrations, training exercises, best practice sessions, security
updates, and other varied presentations focused on security – are the results of
your efforts.

There is no cost or fee to belong to the forum nor are you required to be a
regular attendee to belong. Everyone involved in administrating or engineering
computer systems are welcome to join us.
