#### 0900: Matt Scheurer – Becoming an IR Superstar
**Abstract:**  
Are you an aspiring Incident Responder? Perhaps looking to advance from a career as a
Security Operation Center (SOC) analyst? Or simply intrigued by the technical aspects of being an
Incident Response (IR) professional? IR analysts and engineers conduct investigations to answer the
classic “Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How” questions in responding to security alerts and
incidents. Incident Responders utilize a working knowledge of Defensive Security, Offensive Security,
and Digital Forensics to conduct their investigations. During this presentation, we cover the technical
skills and baseline knowledge required on the roadmap to becoming an IR Superstar!  
**Bio:**  
Matt Scheurer is a show host for the ThreatReel Podcast, and also works as an Assistant Vice
President of Computer Security and Incident Response in a large enterprise environment. Matt has
many years of hands-on technical experience, including Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).
He volunteers as a &quot;Hacking is NOT a Crime&quot; Advocate and as a technical mentor for the Women&#39;s
Security Alliance (WomSA). Matt is a 2019 comSpark “Rising Tech Stars Award” winner. Matt has
presented on numerous Information Security topics at many technology meetup groups and prominent
Information Security conferences across the country.

#### 1000: Scott Nusbaum – Ransomware Is NOT the problem
**Abstract:**  
Challenging the commonly reported belief that Ransomware is the main problem effecting
companies today. But, if you ask people what is ransomware, you will get various answers, and most of
them are wrong. Let&#39;s discuss what Ransomware is and why is it just the scapegoat for a more serious
issue, that the attacker already owns the environment. We will reverse engineer a ransomware sample
to understand its basic functionality and how it differs from commodity malware, walkthrough common
paths of a &quot;Ransomware&quot; attack, areas of a ransomware event that organizations forget, overlook, or
outright ignore, and how security products fail to protect against ransomware.

**Bio:**  
Scott Nusbaum is a Principal Security Consultant at TrustedSec focusing on research and Incident
Response. Scott has worked in IT for over 23 years ranging from Software Developer to Reverse
Engineer. 17 of those years in various aspects of Security. Scott has a bachelor&#39;s in Computer
Engineering and a master&#39;s in Computer Science with a focus on Cyber Informatics from the University
of Cincinnati. Holds the GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM) and the Offensive Security Certified
Expert (OSCE) certifications. Scott has always been fascinated with how exactly computers and software
operate. Scott&#39;s passion for learning the inner workings of systems led to Reverse Engineering, Malware,
exploitation development, and CTF.

#### 1100: Dr. Phu Phung – Hybrid image-based approaches for modern malware classification
**Abstract:**  
We present multiple hybrid methods of analyzing different software categories for machine
learning-based malware classification. In the first approach, we introduce a novel image transformation
method using statistical, syntactic artifacts, and space-filling curves to convert binary software into color
3D images with semantic information. The second approach is to use static analysis to extract the
Interprocedural Control Flow Graph and an additional set of features from a Java bytecode program to
produce a grayscale image. We also extract an additional set of features from Java malware programs to
improve the accuracy of the malware classification.  

We evaluate our approaches by leveraging machine learning algorithms, including shallow (XGBoost)
and deep (Convolutional Neural Network) learning classifiers for the classification of various datasets of
malware. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperformed related
works and can detect both known and previously-unseen real-world malicious programs.  

**Bio:**  
Dr. Phu H. Phung is an Associate Professor, and Director of the Intelligent Systems Security Lab in
the Department of Computer Science, University of Dayton. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science
in 2011 from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. His research spans security solutions for
intelligent Web, mobile, and IoT systems. He is also interested in malicious software detection. His
works have been published in top security venues with 800+ citations. Dr. Phung has served as a
reviewer for many top security journals and conferences, and on the program committee for over 20
international conferences. Dr. Phung is a senior member of IEEE and ACM.

#### 1300: Micah Brown – How a 1993 CCG prepared me for a life in Info Sec  
**Abstract:**  
Magic the Gathering (MTG) is one of the most iconic and popular customizable card games of
all time. At its heart the game is all about resource management and strategic thinking. Since 1993 MTG
has been able to build and maintain and communicate a constant vision of the game both internally to
create new cards and externally to attract new and old players alike. Join me as I release an open-source
documentation framework with downloadable demo VM. (This is about transforming your
documentation into an easy to read / digest living document)  

**Bio:**  
Micah K Brown is a member of the IT Security Engineering team at American Modern Insurance,
part of the Munich RE Group. Over the past four years he has served as the lead Engineer on the DLP
implementation for Data Loss Prevention for the Munich RE organizations located in North and South
America. In this role Micah has learned the many intricacies of what works in a successful DLP project. In
his free time, Micah serves on the Greater Cincinnati ISSA Chapter as Vice President. Micah graduated
from the University of Cincinnati and holds an active CISSP.

#### 1400: Jerod Brennon – Rethinking Cybersecurity in the Quantum Age  
**Abstract:**  
Quantum computing has already shifted from the realm of science fiction to the realm of
science fact, and practical applications for quantum computing are already finding their way into the
workplace. And just as with any other emerging technology, the cybersecurity implications are taking a
backseat to the business innovations. This puts cybersecurity teams at a disadvantage when it comes to
protecting against threats that leverage this same technology. In this presentation, Jerod will provide
you with a foundational understanding of quantum computing, and he’ll share insights into where
quantum computing stands today, as well as insights into how cybersecurity professionals can better
equip themselves and their teams to defend against new and emerging threats.  

**Bio:**  
By day, Jerod Brennen (@slandail) is a strategic advisor, virtual CISO, public speaker, storyteller. By
night, he’s a husband, father, writer, filmmaker, martial artist, musician, and gamer. It’s fair to say that
he’s earned every gray hair in his beard, having spent his career serving as a cybersecurity leader in
public utilities, retail, higher education, consulting, and technology. Jerod loves to share what he’s
learned over the years every chance he gets: at local and regional professional meetings, at larger
conferences, and online via blogs and podcasts. He has published multiple online information security
courses with Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning, and he also teaches courses in person, both domestically
and internationally. He brings a unique combination of perspective and experience to the table when
helping organizations improve their cybersecurity programs, focusing on the business value of an
effective, efficient, forward-thinking cybersecurity program. At the end of the day, Jerod just wants to
help folks get one step closer to doing what they want to do securely.
