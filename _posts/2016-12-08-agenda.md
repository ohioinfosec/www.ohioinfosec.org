**6:00pm:**

Food and drinks served

### Introduction

A brief overview of the Ohio Information Security Forum.

### **Whose Slide Is It Anyway?**

It's that time of year, again! Just like we did last year, we'll be prepping a
number of slide decks for volunteers to present. No preparation or knowledge
necessary! Some decks are serious, some are funny, most are completely
ridiculous. Be sure to join us for a really fun meeting.
