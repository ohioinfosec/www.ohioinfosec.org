When shopping on Amazon this holiday season, make sure to use [our Amazon
Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/ch/26-1330537) link. It doesn't cost you
anything extra and a portion of the price goes to OISF. It's a simple way to
keep us running.

### CubeSat Secure Communication Notes

We had a very interesting discussion on how to secure [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat) communications, here are those notes:

* Limitations:
    * System limitations
        * 16Mhz Processor
        * 512 kb flash storage (~256 kb workable)
        * 80 kb RAM (unknown workable amount)
        * ~800 bits per second transfer rate
            * Only works when you can see the CubeSat
            * Uses a 16-byte command string
        * Most programming done in C
        * Runs [freeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/)
    * Needs something that will survive a VERY harsh environment
        * Radiation can randomly reset the system, corrupt memory, etc
    * Unknown transfer error rate
    * No guarantees on transfer delivery (think UDP)

* Good things:
    * An attacker breaching the system has little real consequence
        * The attacker could restart the device
        * The attacker could stop commands in progress or issue commands that the CubeSat doesn't need
        * The attacker cannot reprogram the device (firmware is set)
        * The attacker could break international radio regulations
            * This has no real effect on anyone
        * The attack could be annoying, but cannot cause damage

* Thoughts on securing the communications channel:
    * Encryption:
        * [Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
        * [One-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) (based on time window)
            * Size is limited on the device
        * [Shared Secret (pre-shared key)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key)
        * [ED25519 Public Key Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA)
            * It was decided that public-key crypto is far too big to transmit
        * [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm)
            * Design to be self-healing
            * Doesn't require an always-on connection
            * Still probably too big to transmit...
    * Command signing?
    * DirectTV-style Memory Puzzle
        * Send the command as small pieces of useless memory and memory locations that a C program will put into a buffer
        * Once enough pieces have been send, the c program can re-arrage the resulting data into a legitimate command
        * Only the architect of the program knows the correct sequence and memory locations

* Other notes:
    * [WolfSSL could be helpful here](http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/WolfSSL/WolfSSL.shtml)
    * [DNP3 could be used as a communication template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNP3)
    * [Dynamic secrets could be helpful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_secrets)
