#### Abstract:

During this presentation we will be discussing the risk and impact related to the improper disposal of embedded technology devices. I will be covering how malicious actors can scrap critical data from these devices, which could then lead to compromise of your personal or business networks. During this presentation we hope to have an open and free flow of ideas focusing on the risk, how its done, and how do we potentially avoid these issues.
