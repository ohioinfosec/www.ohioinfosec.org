### **Wireshark Workshop**
_By: Matt Scheurer (@c3rkah) & Micah Brown (@micahkbrown)_

#### Abstract

Wireshark is a cross-platform free and open-source packet analyzer, sometimes referred to as a network sniffer or packet sniffer. Wireshark is often used for network troubleshooting and analysis. Wireshark allows users to capture packet data from a live network, or read packets from a previously saved packet capture (PCAP) file. The target audience for this 2-hour training workshop are those wishing to learn the operational basics of using Wireshark for network traffic analysis, with a focus on network security. This is a free live hands-on instructor-led workshop featuring multiple training lab sessions.

NOTE: Please bring a laptop with Wireshark installed on it in order to get the most out of the workshop! The workshop is estimated to take 2hrs to complete.
