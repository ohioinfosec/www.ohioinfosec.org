### Introduction

A brief overview of the Ohio Information Security Forum.

### **Whose Slide Is It Anyway?**

#### Abstract

This year, we'll be prepping a number of slide decks for volunteers to present. No preparation or knowledge necessary! Some decks are serious, some are funny, most are completely ridiculous. Be sure to join us for a really fun meeting.
