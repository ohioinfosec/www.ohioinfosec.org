### Introduction

A brief overview of the Ohio Information Security Forum.

### **Digital Forensics Workshop**
_By: Matt Scheurer_

Matt will be leading a Digital Forensics Workshop.  



**Needed Equipment:**  
Please bring a WiFi enabled laptop with a SSH client installed in order to participate in the hands-on lab exercises!  

**Optional Pre-work:**  
Matt will provide step by step instructions of the commands used during the labs. Attendees already familiar with SSH and Bash basics will be just fine. Anybody relatively new (or looking for a refresher) to Linux and / or SSH may want to brush up before the meeting.
