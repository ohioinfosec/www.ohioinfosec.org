#### Micah Brown - DLP Demystified

Data breaches have become a common fixture of our daily lives. Executives are paying closer attention to their organization’s security posture and funding projects aggressively. Often these projects involve a rollout of flashy new technology and / or devices. These solutions are sold, marketed, and deployed as silver bullet solutions. Technologies such as DLP are open sandbox tools that allow a company to build policies around how data can be stored, processed, and transmitted. It is very easy for a company solely focused on standing up a DLP environment and not provide value to the business.

Micah K Brown is a member of the IT Security Engineering team at American Modern Insurance, part of the Munich RE Group. Over the past four years he has served as the lead Engineer on the DLP implementation for Data Loss Prevention for the Munich RE organizations located in North and South America. In this role Micah has learned the many intricacies of what works in a successful DLP project. In his free time, Micah serves on the Greater Cincinnati ISSA Chapter as Vice President. Micah graduated from the University of Cincinnati and holds an active CISSP.
