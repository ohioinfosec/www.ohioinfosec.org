### About:
It is that time of the year again. Our annual conference is coming up on July 10th. The OISF Annual Conference will be held both in-person and virtually this year. We will be hosting the OISF Annual Conference at Miami Valley Research Park, 1900 Founders Dr, Kettering, OH. It will be the same venue we have used in the past. The conference will start at 9:00 AM and end approximately around 4:30 PM.

There will also be a virtual option to attend this year's conference via Google Meet for those that are unable to attend in person. The Google Meet link will be provided once registration closes on 7/8/21 at 5p EST.

We are seeking donations that are tax-deductible to our Non-Profit 501(c)(3) Learning Charity to allow our organization to share knowledge and conduct training to local Dayton Cybersecurity Professionals. You can also make contributions through Amazon Smile by selecting Ohio Information Security Forum as your charity organization.
