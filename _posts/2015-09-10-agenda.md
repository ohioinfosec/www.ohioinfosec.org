### **An Introduction to Kali Linux**

A complete introduction to Kali Linux, the number one pentesting Linux
distribution. This talk will be the foundation for many of the tools we

### **Low Level Terrorism: New Tools for Modern Activists**
_By: [Virgil VÄƒduva](https://virgilvaduva.com/)_

#### **Abstract:**

A discussion on the current landscape of State surveillance, crypto, and
new tools aimed at subverting surveillance and helping activists meet
their goals. In addition, I'll discuss two new tools I am working on, the
Cell platform and the Cell 411 app I released about a month ago.

#### **Bio:**

Virgil is the founder of 614con, he writes and speaks on security topics
and has over 18 years of security experience in corporate America.
Currently he is taking time off from security work to learn how to make
the best soy sauce in the world, develop mobile apps and think of new
ways to help activists stay out of trouble.
