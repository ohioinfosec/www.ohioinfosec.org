Ward Cunningham’s Txtzyme and Ken Boak’s SIMPL languages - John Roberts

### Abstract
John will present an overview of Ward Cunningham’s Txtzyme and Ken Boak’s SIMPL languages, and show how they can be used effectively to interactively command small microcontrollers and other remote devices to perform various tasks. We will discuss other potential applications of the techniques such as controlling IoT devices, or commanding complex behavior at a remote location using a very small network packet.
