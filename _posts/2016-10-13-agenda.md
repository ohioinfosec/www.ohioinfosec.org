### **A Day in the Life of a Pentester**
_By: [Robert Stewart, Security Analyst @ Rapid7](https://rizzyrong.com/)_

#### Abstract

As a pentester I work with customers to identify their goals and expectations of
an internal assessment. Generally, these goals and expectations boil down to,
‘what is the risk of an attacker with access to the internal network achieve?’.
We typically consider an attacker without any access, or an average user being
able to elevate their privileges to Domain Administrator (DA) as full
compromise. Surprisingly, most of the internal assessments I’ve done are
composed of a several steps to achieve DA access.

In this presentation I will walk through those steps and show what can be
achieved when a user has no access to the network. Starting with gaining access
to a user account and then latterly moving through the network to compromise
Active Directory (AD).

#### Bio

I’ve worked in most areas of Information Technology for the past twelve years,
most recently hacking all the things.
