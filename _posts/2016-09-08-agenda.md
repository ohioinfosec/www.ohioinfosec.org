### Introduction

A brief overview of the Ohio Information Security Forum.

### **More Secure Shared Hosting with FreeBSD Jails**
_By: [Tom Webster](https://samurailink3.com/)_

#### Abstract

Bad code or compromises in one site can affect other sites on the same system.
In this talk, I'll explain how that happens and how BSD Jails can help prevent
tragedy. This will be very demo-heavy.
