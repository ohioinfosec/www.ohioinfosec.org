### Introduction

A brief overview of the Ohio Information Security Forum.

### **Networked Surveillance Systems: Where Physical & Information Security Meet**
_By: Charles Monett_

#### Abstract

Things go bump in the night.  Something goes missing.  We want to know why.  In
this presentation, we discuss how to design and set up a networked surveillance
system.  A dual emphasis will be provided on security and privacy - often
overlooked concerns.

#### Bio

In addition to refining his own surveillance system and volunteering for OISF,
Charles has additional interests in UNIX, Python, and networked devices.  For 4
years, Charles worked at Dayton Daily News in an IT support capacity.

In 2015, he earned a Management Information Systems degree from Wright State
University and was inducted into the Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
