#### Abstract

This presentation will discuss the product of nearly a year’s worth of
opportunistic credential scanning data collected from Heisenberg, Rapid7’s
public-facing network of low-interaction honeypots. Instead of focusing on the
passwords that end users typically pick, with this data we can see what
opportunistic scanners are using in order to test— and likely compromise—
Internet connected point of sale (POS) systems, kiosks, and scamware-compromised
desktop PCs which offer the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service for remote
management.
