#### Abstract

Gamification can make learning more fun, and some people are inspired and motivated by competition. This talk will be on integrating hobbyist electronics with lock picking games. We will show rough schematics, release code, and invite people to play the games at the con.

### Jerod Brennen

{% img left /images/2014-anniversary/jerod_brennen.jpg %}

#### Bio

By day, I'm a Principal Information Security Consultant with more years of technical and management experience than I care to admit. In that role, I'm a strong advocate of reasonable and appropriate security controls that support the goals of the business.

By night, I'm a husband, father, writer, filmmaker, martial artist, musician, gamer, and social media junkie. Trying to work my way up to superhero. Not there yet.

I present regularly at information security conferences on a variety of topics, based on hands-on experience in different information security domains. If there's such a thing as an InfoSec Renaissance Man, I'd argue that I just might be that guy.
