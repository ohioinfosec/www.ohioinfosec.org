#### Abstract

It seems that businesses are truly struggling with how to handle the
threats we face as organizations when it comes to information security.
From breach to breach, the techniques seem similar yet they completely
rip through everything we’ve tried to protect against. As an industry,
we’re fighting to define ourselves in a manner where we can actively
combat the different demographics we see from attackers. This
presentation will walk through what we face as organizations, both
politically as well as an industry. Information security isn’t a
technology problem – it’s a social issue. Until we recognize that, we
will continue to see the continued breaches year after year as we
continue to battle (and lose) the same types of attacks.  There’s a lot
of talk inside the industry on technical controls, products, adversarial
simulation, and more for strengthening our defenses. These couldn’t be
further away from what we really need to combat these types of attacks.
This talk will also be demonstrating effective measures to combat some of
the main techniques attackers use in order to attack an organization.
