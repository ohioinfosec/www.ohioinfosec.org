#### Abstract

It seems that businesses are truly struggling with how to handle the
threats we face as organizations when it comes to information security.
From breach to breach, the techniques seem similar yet they completely
rip through everything we’ve tried to protect against. As an industry,
we’re fighting to define ourselves in a manner where we can actively
combat the different demographics we see from attackers. This
presentation will walk through what we face as organizations, both
politically as well as an industry. Information security isn’t a
technology problem – it’s a social issue. Until we recognize that, we
will continue to see the continued breaches year after year as we
continue to battle (and lose) the same types of attacks.  There’s a lot
of talk inside the industry on technical controls, products, adversarial
simulation, and more for strengthening our defenses. These couldn’t be
further away from what we really need to combat these types of attacks.
This talk will also be demonstrating effective measures to combat some of
the main techniques attackers use in order to attack an organization.

#### Abstract

With growing trends in globalization, the Information
Technology bundle of industries continue to be saturated
with bodies and starving for talent at the same time. In
this session, hear the perception of a basement hacker
turned IT professional about learning how to learn, the
challenges of growing up in "the underground", and bridging
the gap into the professional arena; and members of the
Reynoldsburg High School Cyber Patriot team who are forging
their skills and identities within the Information Security
crowd. We have to grow beyond "turning it off and then
turning it back on again". Fostering the growth of talented
kids is vital to strengthening the ranks of industry roles
in the future by getting involved and engaging them on their
turf. This is a high-level discussion on how we (and our
peers) view, interact with, and take part in watering the
fruit of tomorrow's IT Crowd.

#### Abstract

We have seen PowerShell gain attention and adoption in the last few
years. People are beginning to realize that there is more to PowerShell
than another scripting language. With the adoption comes more tools and
resources for both the offensive and defensive sides of security. This
talk is designed to give you a first hand look of using PowerShell in
both an offensive attacking scenario as well as a defensive scenario. In
this talk I will be focusing on the tools, methods, and techniques that
are being used from both offensive and defensive mindsets. I will
highlight existing tools that can be leveraged as well as teach you how
to write some custom tools yourself. We will dive into the more complex
ideas with PowerShell and the .NET Framework. At the end of this talk,
you will learn that there are many ways to leverage PowerShell to your
advantage; regardless of what color hat you wear.
